  <blockquote>
  <p>Luke 9:2-3 ESV</p>

  <p>[2] and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal. [3] And he said to them, “Take nothing for your journey, no staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not have two tunics.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="he-is-enough">He is enough!</h1>

<p>This verse was describing the scenario in which Jesus sent out His disciples to preach the Kingdom of God and to heal the sick. He had given them the power to drive out demons and cure diseases.</p>

<p>When Jesus told them to bring nothing but the clothes on their back, He was telling them to trust that God will provide for them. As I reflect on this, I can’t help but think of the difficulty I would have right now trusting someone who told me to leave everything an wander to different cities on foot. What about food? What about water? What about shelter? These are basic needs we all have.</p>

<p>To really put this into perspective, the disciples were wandering through harsh land. The Middle East is not a very comfortable place (trust me, I’ve been there). The picture above is similar to the environment they were traversing without transportation, GPS, a map.</p>

<p>If anyone other than Jesus had told them this, I doubt that they would have even considered going on this journey. Unless, if course, that person was truly speaking on God’s behalf. In spite of all this, the disciples put their trust in God and went on their way, healing the sick and preaching the gospel.</p>

<p>In Psalm 16:5, David proclaims,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Lord you have assigned me my portion and my cup; you have made my lot secure.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>God was enough then and He always will be enough. Later on in Psalm chapter 73, Asaph (a Levite musician appointed by David) starts with a confession of his envy. He was envious of the wicked who seem to be healthy and prosperous. He knows this is wrong and changes his tone, because he knows the truth.</p>

<p>In verse 26 he says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Forever is a long time, God is that great. He is enough! Finally, in the book of Lamentations, even in the midst of great turmoil after Jerusalem was destroyed by the Babylonians, the writer says this,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I say to myself, ‘The Lord is my portion; therefore I will wait for him.’”</p>

  <p>- Lamentations 3:24</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>He is enough!</strong> He is all we will ever need. Our lives are in God’s hands. When we are called, we must answer and put our trust in Him.</p>

<p>The Lord will provide.</p>

<p><strong>He is enough!</strong></p>
