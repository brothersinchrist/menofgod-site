    <p>“Some time later God tested Abraham. He said to him, “Abraham!” “Here I am,” he replied. Then God said, “Take your son, your only son, whom you love—Isaac—and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on a mountain I will show you.””</p>

<p>Genesis 22:1-2 NIV</p>

<p>I know, I know, we’ve all heard the story a thousand times. But stop and think about how this could have felt. How close to God must you be to know, without doubt, it is He Who said you must do this?  God does test us. Not through temptations, but through commands that challenge us. I’ve heard sermons, read other books and saw movies about how this played out, but no one knows any more than what is said here in The Word. Abraham immediately did what God commanded. And, without God stopping him at the last second, would have sacrificed Isaac. No, he wasn’t perfect, but Abraham’s faith was amazing. That’s the main thing we need to remember from this story. We must have faith that God will do what He has promised, no matter what else happens, what He has to overcome or how far He has to go. God is true and belief in that, no matter what, is the faith He requires.</p>
