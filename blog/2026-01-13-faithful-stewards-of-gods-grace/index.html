<p><strong>Living for God</strong><br>
1_Therefore, since Christ suffered in his body, arm yourselves also with the same attitude, because whoever suffers in the body is done with sin._ 2 <em>As a result, they do not live the rest of their earthly lives for evil human desires, but rather for the will of God.</em> 3 <em>For you have spent enough time in the past doing what pagans choose to do—living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness, orgies, carousing and detestable idolatry.</em> 4 <em>They are surprised that you do not join them in their reckless, wild living, and they heap abuse on you.</em> 5 <em>But they will have to give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.</em> 6 <em>For this is the reason the gospel was preached even to those who are now dead, so that they might be judged according to human standards in regard to the body, but live according to God in regard to the spirit.</em></p>
<p>7 <em>The end of all things is near. Therefore be alert and of sober mind so that you may pray.</em> 8 <em>Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.</em> 9 <em>Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling.</em> 10 <em>Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms.</em> 11 <em>If anyone speaks, they should do so as one who speaks the very words of God. If anyone serves, they should do so with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>-–1 Peter 4 - NIV</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The apostle Peter is reminding us that God has forgiven us of much sin and to use our newfound faith in Christ for the building up of the church and for the glory of God.</p>
<p>Brothers it is of the upmost importance that we are committed to being faithful before God at all times with the understanding that he knows all things and his Grace abides(remains). We have all had moment where the stressors of life and lust of the flesh bring us to a crossroads where we (Men of God) must  choose to trust and obey that he knows what he (God) is doing and what’s best for us. We have and will continue to experience hard times like sickness, sometimes frustrating moments at work with a difficult coworker or Boss or even at home in the place that you would hope to feel the safest from the presents of sin and spiritual conflict.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.”</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>-–John‬ ‭16‬:‭33‬ ‭NIV‬‬</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>We have been called out from the world to live for God and his glory so let’s get our house in order. We don’t have to suffer in silence. We have the Holy Spirit. We have Gods word and we have each other.</p>
<p>Galatians(6:2)</p>
<p>James (5:14-16)</p>
<p>The Lord is doing a work in our hearts and in his perfect timing we his (children) will see the goodness of our God if done despair or conformed to this world.</p>
<p>Philippians(1:6)</p>
<p>Romans(12:2)</p>
