  <p>Luke 9:2-3 ESV</p>

  <p>[2] and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal. [3] And he said to them, “Take nothing for your journey, no staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not have two tunics.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="he-is-enough">He is enough!</h1>

<p>This verse was describing the scenario in which Jesus sent out His disciples to preach the Kingdom of God and to heal the sick. He had given them the power to drive out demons and cure diseases.</p>

<p>When Jesus told them to bring nothing but the clothes on their back, He was telling them to trust that God will provide for them. As I reflect on this, I can’t help but think of the difficulty I would have right now trusting someone who told me to leave everything an wander to different cities on foot. What about food? What about water? What about shelter? These are basic needs we all have.</p>

<p>To really put this into perspective, the disciples were wandering through harsh land. The Middle East is not a very comfortable place (trust me, I’ve been there). The picture above is similar to the environment they were traversing without transportation, GPS, a map.</p>

<p>If anyone other than Jesus had told them this, I doubt that they would have even considered going on this journey. Unless, if course, that person was truly speaking on God’s behalf. In spite of all this, the disciples put their trust in God and went on their way, healing the sick and preaching the gospel.</p>

<p>In Psalm 16:5, David proclaims,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Lord you have assigned me my portion and my cup; you have made my lot secure.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>God was enough then and He always will be enough. Later on in Psalm chapter 73, Asaph (a Levite musician appointed by David) starts with a confession of his envy. He was envious of the wicked who seem to be healthy and prosperous. He knows this is wrong and changes his tone, because he knows the truth.</p>

<p>In verse 26 he says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Forever is a long time, God is that great. He is enough! Finally, in the book of Lamentations, even in the midst of great turmoil after Jerusalem was destroyed by the Babylonians, the writer says this,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I say to myself, ‘The Lord is my portion; therefore I will wait for him.’”</p>

  <p>- Lamentations 3:24</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>He is enough!</strong> He is all we will ever need. Our lives are in God’s hands. When we are called, we must answer and put our trust in Him.</p>

<p>The Lord will provide.</p>

<p><strong>He is enough!</strong></p>]]></content><author><name>Tom Parks</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Luke 9:2-3 ESV [2] and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal.

<p>The apostle Peter is reminding us that God has forgiven us of much sin and to use our newfound faith in Christ for the building up of the church and for the glory of God.</p>

<p>Brothers it is of the upmost importance that we are committed to being faithful before God at all times with the understanding that he knows all things and his Grace abides(remains). We have all had moment where the stressors of life and lust of the flesh bring us to a crossroads where we (Men of God) must  choose to trust and obey that he knows what he (God) is doing and what’s best for us. We have and will continue to experience hard times like sickness, sometimes frustrating moments at work with a difficult coworker or Boss or even at home in the place that you would hope to feel the safest from the presents of sin and spiritual conflict.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.”</em></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>-–John‬ ‭16‬:‭33‬ ‭NIV‬‬</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>We have been called out from the world to live for God and his glory so let’s get our house in order. We don’t have to suffer in silence. We have the Holy Spirit. We have Gods word and we have each other.</p>

<p>Galatians(6:2)</p>

<p>James (5:14-16)</p>

<p>The Lord is doing a work in our hearts and in his perfect timing we his (children) will see the goodness of our God if done despair or conformed to this world.</p>

<p>Genesis 22:1-2 NIV</p>

<p>I know, I know, we’ve all heard the story a thousand times. But stop and think about how this could have felt. How close to God must you be to know, without doubt, it is He Who said you must do this?  God does test us. Not through temptations, but through commands that challenge us. I’ve heard sermons, read other books and saw movies about how this played out, but no one knows any more than what is said here in The Word. Abraham immediately did what God commanded. And, without God stopping him at the last second, would have sacrificed Isaac. No, he wasn’t perfect, but Abraham’s faith was amazing. That’s the main thing we need to remember from this story. We must have faith that God will do what He has promised, no matter what else happens, what He has to overcome or how far He has to go. God is true and belief in that, no matter what, is the faith He requires.</p>]]></content><author><name>Bible </name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Some time later God tested Abraham.
